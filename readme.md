## What?

Node-Queue-Bus is a plugin for [Resque](https://github.com/resque/resque) (we use [node-resque](https://github.com/taskrabbit/node-resque) for this project) which transforms Resque into a distributed message bus.  This allows more than one application to share workloads on the bus, and for events/jobs to fan out to more than one application.  Perhaps you want the `user_created` event to be consumed by the `analytics` and `email` applications... then QueueBus is for you.

This application is a [port of the main ruby project](https://github.com/queue-bus/queue-bus) to node.js.  This project is likley to be behind the Ruby project.  However, this package aims to be 100% compatible with the Ruby version, and can fill a driver, rider, or scheduler role within that same ecosystm (more information below).

## Ecosystem

The publishing application sends an event (`bus.publish()`).  This event is entered into an `incomming` resque queue.  The Rider/Driver then inspects `subscriptions` and sends the event over to queues for application which have registered interest in the event.  Then, finally, workers for those events consume the jobs in a normal resque way.  You can also delay a publication `bus.publishAt()`, and in that case, a Scheduler is required to coordinate.

## Subscribing and Publishing.

We use the 'bus' object to both subscribe and publish events.  It should be passed your `connectionDetails` and optionally `jobs` (see [node-resque](https://github.com/taskrabbit/node-resque) for more information about `connectionDetails` and `jobs`)

```javascript
var BusPrototype = require("node-queue-bus").bus;
var bus = new BusPrototype({connection: connectionDetails}, jobs, function(err){
  // subscribe "myApp" to all events that match `user_*` (like `user_created`, `user_updated`, etc)
  // use the "default" priority, which would make events appear in the "myapp_default" queue in resque
  // when we get events matching `user_*`, run the job "handleUser"
  bus.subscribe('myApp', 'default', 'handleUser', { bus_event_type : /^user_.*/ });
});
```

Once your `bus` is connected, you can publish events.  You must always define 'bus_event_type' and then an optional hash of data:

```javascript
bus.publish('user_created', {
  email: 'evan@site.com',
});

bus.publishIn(1000, 'user_updated', {
  email: 'evan@site.com',
  userId: 123,
});

bus.publishIn(1000, 'user_updated', {
  email_was: 'evan@site.com',
  email_is:  'evan2@site.com',
  userId: 123,
});
```
### Methods:

- `bus.subscriptions(callback(error, subsciptions, count))`
- `bus.subscribe(callback(appKey, priority, job, matcher, callback(error, queue_name)))`
- `bus.unsubscribe(callback(appKey, priority, job, callback))`
- `bus.unsubscribeAll(callback(appKey, callback))`
- `bus.publish(bus_event_type, args, callback(error, toRun))`
- `bus.publishAt(timestamp, bus_event_type, args, callback(error, toRun))`
- `bus.publishIn(delay, bus_event_type, args, callback(error, toRun))`

Keep in mind that if you use `publishAt` or `publishIn`, you will need to have a `Scheduler` running in your ecosystem.

### Matching and Special Keys

You can use a single string `{ bus_event_type: 'add' }` or regex `{ bus_event_type : /^.*add.*/ }` to match events in your subscription.  There are also special keys you can use:

- `bus_special_value_key`     (key is not null)
- `bus_special_value_blank`   (key exists but is blank (''))
- `bus_special_value_empty`   (key is null)
- `bus_special_value_nil`     (key is undefined)
- `bus_special_value_value`   (key is not null)
- `bus_special_value_present` (key is not null and has a length > 0)

For example, a matcher like `{ first_name: 'bus_special_value_present' }` would match all events where the field 'first_name' is present.

### Subsciption Notes

- Be sure to subscribe before you start working.
- Subscribing returns `error` and `worker_queue` to the `callback`.  You can then use `worker_queue` to tell your worker what queues to work.
  - When subscribing, `appKey` will always be lowercased, and all spaces will be replaced with `"_"`
  - You can subscribe any number of times with no adverse effects.  Feel free to do it from every server at boot.
- All times should be in JS micoseconds (unix timestamp * 1000).  This project will convert them to unix timesamps to match Ruby when needed.  

## Rider

Running a rider is just like running a normal resque worker with the added bonus that it will also work the incomming queue to fan out jobs when its primary queues are empty.  The rider takes the same inputs as a worker, and simply appends some special jobs to handle the fan-out and bus queues.

```javascript
var rider = new RiderPrototype({connection: connectionDetails, toDrive: true}, jobs, function(){
  rider.workerCleanup(); // optional: cleanup any previous improperly shutdown workers
  rider.start();
});
```
You can configure some additional options as well (see the resque-bus project for more information):

```javascript
options = {
  looping: true,
  timeout: 5000,
  name:    os.hostname() + ":" + process.pid
}
```

### Rider Notes

- When using a regexp matcher, we will attempt to [convert JS's RegExp to a ruby regular expression](https://github.com/queue-bus/node-bus/blob/master/lib/sections/utils.js#L28-L84).  This conversion is less than perfect, and there are liley to be problems with more complex matchers.  Please let us know if you find something wrong and open a GitHub issue.

## Data

When an event is passed though the entire bus, metadata is added by both the publisher and the rider. You can overwrite any of these fields in your `attributes` hash.  A simple event like `bus.publish('add', {a: 5, b: 10})` will yeild:

```javascript
{
   "class":"remoteEventSubtract",
   "queue":"exampleapp_default",
   "args":{
      "bus_driven_at":1392251619,
      "bus_rider_queue":"exampleapp_default",
      "bus_rider_app_key":"exampleapp",
      "bus_rider_sub_key":"exampleapp_default_remoteEventSubtract",
      "bus_rider_class_name":"remoteEventSubtract",
      "bus_event_type":"subtract",
      "bus_published_at":1392251614,
      "bus_id":"1392251614-6a3d3a00-9cde-4877-9e53-9c580a0caa07",
      "bus_app_hostname":"OpsimusPrime.local",
      "a":5,
      "b":10
   }
}
```
